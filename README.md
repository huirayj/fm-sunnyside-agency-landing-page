## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this exercise, I learned to use the "background" to add background images.

```css
header {
	background-image: url('../images/desktop/image-header.jpg');
	background-size: cover;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: center;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	height: 85vh;
}
```

In this snippet, the header is given a background image.

### Useful resources

- [background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the CSS "background" property
- [background-size](https://cssreference.io/property/background-size/) - Here is another resource on "background", specifically, "background-size".
